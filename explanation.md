HowBrowsersWork



Hi I am Qusai

I will explain the functionalities  of the web browser , but before we start lets define a Web Browser...

A web browser is a software application used to access the Internet in order to retrieve / present information




Function of Browser:
The main function of a Browser is to present resources that have been requested by the user from the server, and display it in the browser window. Usually the resources are an HTML ,XHML ,PDF ,  images, video or any other content . The location of the resources is determined by the user input in the address bar it's called URL(Uniform Resource Identifier ). you can think of it as the index that refer to that specific content in the server DB (data base).



The way Browser interpret   HTML files is specified buy the HTML & CSS specifications .The HTML & CSS specifications are set by W3C organization(World Wide Web Consortium) , its standard organization for Web. for years Browsers confirmed only part of the specifications and developed the own extensions . That caused a serious compatibility issues for Web authors and developers.
Now days most of the Browsers more or less confirm to the specifications .
